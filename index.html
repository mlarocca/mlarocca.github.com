	  <h2><a href="/12-29-2012/Dynamic-Charts.html">Dynamic-Charts</a></h2>
	  29 Dec 2012
	   <p>Dynamic-Charts is a high-level lib built on <em>D3js</em> to allow for easy and quick development of dynamically populated charts, especially thought to represent live, real-time data.</p>

<p>Four charts are available now (a fifth is going to be added soon): 3 bar charts (a more basic one with bars&#39; size adjusting according to the size of the dataset plot and 2 more advanced ones for which the bar size is fixed and set on creation, and older data is discarded - in a settable ratio - to make room for new values), plus a &quot;wheel&quot; chart especially thought for plotting data literally &quot;on the clock&quot;.
All of these charts support multidimensional data and can be fed with custom formatted data, by setting an appropriate custom &quot;interpreter&quot; function, so that, for example, JSON support is easily and automatically achieved.
All of them, moreover, are higly customizable in their appearance: colors, backgrounds, labels size and color, axes (position, colors, visibility, size, number of nothces), titles and so on.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/12-19-2012/javascript_OOE.html">Combining effective encapsulation and inheritance in JavaScript</a></h2>
	  19 Dec 2012
	   <p>While developing a plugin for the D3 graphic library, I found myself facing one of the most common conundrum for a JavaScript programmer: how on Earth is it possible to get a good compromise between encapsulation and extensibility?</p> <p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are many different known techniques to safely and effectively keep private attributes and methods really private (mostly involving closure and local vars), as well as there are many more to mimic inheritance, from pseudo-classical to prototypal or parasitic ones. A very good source of inspiration for all of these techniques can be found on <em>Douglas Crockford</em> web sites or, if you have a little bit more time, in some of his great videos on <em>YUITheather</em> (a must for any JS developer).</p> <p>But as far as I know there have been only a few attempts to cope with both problems at the same time: there is no &quot;protected&quot; encapsulation in JavaScript, and none of them looks particularly easy or satisfying to me. And that&#39;s a bummer, I mean, web development today is all about mash-ups, and every JS engineer at some point will have to exploit mash-ups, so she will be (well, at least he really SHOULD BE) necessarily concerned about the methods that his objects are going to expose to consumers.</p> <p>The most common solution starts, or at least it should, from embracing an Object Capability System. In such a paradigm, Objects can communicate with other objects only if they have a reference to them (as usual),...
