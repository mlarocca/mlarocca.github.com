PyCrawler is a simple but functional crawler written in Python.

It's a very humble crawler indeed, and I'm not making any claim this is going to solve your crawling problems: it's just a spare time project, built in a couple of hours for fun and as a challenge. It only crawls static content, and ignores url fragments.

Nonetheless, I tried to give it a general and robust structure and I think it is a good basis to build a decent crawler.
At the time of writing, it has the following properties:
* Breadth-first crawling
* Parallel crawling (the number of crawlers running in different threadsin parallel is totally customizable at runtime)
* Keeps track of the static resources referenced, and builds a map of the website crawled (starting from any page retrieved)
* Crawls only pages within one single domain (determined by the starting page)
* Can be set at runtime so that the number of pages crawled will be limited
* Supports an elementary mechanism of polite crawling
