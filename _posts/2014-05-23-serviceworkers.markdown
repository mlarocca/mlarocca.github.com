title: ServiceWorker Holds Great Promise for Caching and Offline Applications
---

The **ServiceWorker** specification allows scripts to cache resources and handle all resource requests for an application even when a network isn't available. To put it in a different way, the ServiceWorker browser feature enables developers to build applications that work offline, overcoming the limits of **HTML5 Application Cache** (AppCache) by giving developers a set of primitives to handle every HTTP call on a Website, as well as controlling installation and updates for the cache rules.

Sounds cool, right? Well, it is. Interested in going in-depth? A few resources:
